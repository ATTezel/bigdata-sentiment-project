        "selftext": "Hey r/Strava! So I've been working on Hunter KOM for a while now, and just pushed V2 with improvements that honestly have me more excited than I expected.The biggest game-changer: The filtering algorithm is now ridiculously smarter. Before in V1, I'd search an area and Hunter KOM would show me like 20 segments - most of them completely unrealistic pipe dreams. Now in V2? Same area shows only 7 segments, but they're actually segments I can realistically crush based on my climbing data.What's new in Hunter KOM V2:\n\n* Smart color-coded realism: Green = \"go get it right now\", Yellow = \"train a bit and it's yours\", Red = \"future goals but totally doable\"\n\n* Flexible map views: Detail view for precision hunting, Wide view for broader exploration, Balanced view for optimal coverage\n\n* Dark/Light themes (finally!)\n\n* Enhanced segment analysis - KOM holder details, times, everything you need to plan your attack\n\n* Smarter algorithm that actually understands your VAM and climbing ability\n\nThe difference is night and day. Instead of getting discouraged by impossible segments, Hunter KOM V2 now shows you segments where you can actually make progress and build confidence.\\[Video demo attached - you can see the V2 improvements in action\\]Feel free to try Hunter KOM V2 and come back with a review here or shoot me a DM! I'm really curious if the new color coding system matches your real-world experience when you tackle these segments.\n\nLink: [Hunter KOM](https://hunter-kom.com)\n\nAnyone else using Hunter KOM and notice the V2 improvements? The algorithm upgrade feels like a completely different tool now!",

An added benefit was the main road I ran on when for 5km straight with only 1 stop sign, no lights (and obviously as a pedestrian I had right of way anyway). Idk if this is a universal sentiment but I never realized how bad running on sidewalks is until I’ve been forced to do it. There are some threads online about how sidewalks are harder than asphalt roads and while that’s probably true I’m not sure if that is noticeable to any meaningful degree. What I really don’t like about sidewalks is I feel like I’m having to be way more conscious of where my feet are landing, and then that’s sort of limiting my stride length in weird ways and making it varied, ie I start getting too close to the cracks and then I have to adjust and either start taking longer or shorter strides. Even if each sidewalk section was perfectly level I feel like the lines themselves throw me off mentally, like for some reason I just don’t want to step on the lines. \n\nSo I’m wondering if there’s a way to automatically find good running routes that don’t have sidewalks without driving all around the city and trying to find them.

I have also had an increase in random followers (+10)  in 2025 (In Q2? Maybe some in Q1).\n\nWhile I do sync all my activities into Strava, biking (distance cycling) is my primary and I'm getting followed by non-bikers. Typical Strava behavior in north east US:  we connect at or after events, or via your contacts/Facebook. The new followers I'm getting are completely random and geographically dispersed, and do not appear to be cyclists. I have not \"followed back\" on any of these. \r\n\r\nMy primary concern:  there are patterns in these new followers. They tend to have IDs using first name with an initial for last name. 8 of the 10 are from across the country (CA), are young, Asian women with sexy photos taken from behind or just parts of their body, with a few scenery shots. The few bike pictures appear to be modeling shots, with nice bikes and kits, but few 2-3 mile rides that don't relate (i.e. age, gear, activity don't go together). 5 of 10 are from San Francisco, and its beem 7 years since my last visit there. Most have very few activities. They tend to have few followers but are following much more.  2 of the 10 are now inaccessible,  but cant be removed from my Follower list (Strava developers possibly active?). \r\n\r\nIf this is benign and just new users trying to follow active people—no issue. However, it's the pattern I'm experiencing (anecdotal ?) combined with the number of posts here on Reddit with people experiencing the same thing. \n\nAs an IT professional, it feels like something is happening. I am wondering if this is a calculated effort, programming just getting started to pollute the Strava user base. There is the potential for harm with times and location of peoples' activities visible. So I'd ask the question: is something going on for potential phishing or personal data access in Strava? \n",

Strava seems to record it with very short \"moving time\", when \"elapsed time\" should be the main determinant of pace.
