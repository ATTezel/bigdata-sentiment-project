1lmkyvz,Hunter KOM V2 just dropped - the algorithm got WAY smarter and I'm genuinely excited!,"Hey r/Strava! So I've been working on Hunter KOM for a while now, and just pushed V2 with improvements that honestly have me more excited than I expected.The biggest game-changer: The filtering algorithm is now ridiculously smarter. Before in V1, I'd search an area and Hunter KOM would show me like 20 segments - most of them completely unrealistic pipe dreams. Now in V2? Same area shows only 7 segments, but they're actually segments I can realistically crush based on my climbing data.What's new in Hunter KOM V2:

* Smart color-coded realism: Green = ""go get it right now"", Yellow = ""train a bit and it's yours"", Red = ""future goals but totally doable""

* Flexible map views: Detail view for precision hunting, Wide view for broader exploration, Balanced view for optimal coverage

* Dark/Light themes (finally!)

* Enhanced segment analysis - KOM holder details, times, everything you need to plan your attack

* Smarter algorithm that actually understands your VAM and climbing ability

The difference is night and day. Instead of getting discouraged by impossible segments, Hunter KOM V2 now shows you segments where you can actually make progress and build confidence.\[Video demo attached - you can see the V2 improvements in action\]Feel free to try Hunter KOM V2 and come back with a review here or shoot me a DM! I'm really curious if the new color coding system matches your real-world experience when you tackle these segments.

1lmk0da,Nutrition tips for Ironman 70.3?,"
I’m doing my first Ironman 70.3 soon (not racing, just want to see if I can finish), and wanted to ask for nutrition tips.

For my last marathon, I kept it super simple: I ate 4 Sour Patch Kids every 30 minutes and had half of a protein waffle every other 30 minutes. That came out to ~125 calories/hour, and it worked well enough for me. Planning to do something similar for the 70.3 and sip electrolytes along the way.

Would love to hear your thoughts:

Is 125 cal/hr enough for a 70.3 at a steady, non-race pace?
What do you eat on the bike vs. the run?
Any rookie mistakes I should avoid?
Do you plan differently if you're just trying to finish vs. race?
I’m not trying to hit a time goal - just looking to enjoy the day and cross the finish line upright. Appreciate any insights from the community!",1,2,1751108094.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1lmk0da/nutrition_tips_for_ironman_703/,"Nutrition tips for Ironman 70.3?

1lm2ymv,"Recent (Q2 2025±) increase in random, new Followers","Reference: 
Within the last 4 months, other Reddit posts in the Strava subreddit titled
• Random followers   
• New Followers   
• My new ""followers""  
• New female followers?  
• Lots of new ""spam like"" followers.   

I would like to echo the questions and concerns of these other posts over the past 4-5 months. I have also had an increase in random followers (+10)  in 2025 (In Q2? Maybe some in Q1).

While I do sync all my activities into Strava, biking (distance cycling) is my primary and I'm getting followed by non-bikers. Typical Strava behavior in north east US:  we connect at or after events, or via your contacts/Facebook. The new followers I'm getting are completely random and geographically dispersed, and do not appear to be cyclists. I have not ""followed back"" on any of these. 

My primary concern:  there are patterns in these new followers. They tend to have IDs using first name with an initial for last name. 8 of the 10 are from across the country (CA), are young, Asian women with sexy photos taken from behind or just parts of their body, with a few scenery shots. The few bike pictures appear to be modeling shots, with nice bikes and kits, but few 2-3 mile rides that don't relate (i.e. age, gear, activity don't go together). 5 of 10 are from San Francisco, and its beem 7 years since my last visit there. Most have very few activities. They tend to have few followers but are following much more.  2 of the 10 are now inaccessible,  but cant be removed from my Follower list (Strava developers possibly active?). 

If this is benign and just new users trying to follow active people—no issue. However, it's the pattern I'm experiencing (anecdotal ?) combined with the number of posts here on Reddit with people experiencing the same thing. 

As an IT professional, it feels like something is happening. I am wondering if this is a calculated effort, programming just getting started to pollute the Strava user base. There is the potential for harm with times and location of peoples' activities visible. So I'd ask the question: is something going on for potential phishing or personal data access in Strava?
